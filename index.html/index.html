          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <section class="about-me-container">
        <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Adrienne, and I am learning to become a full stack web developer.  I have spent the last 10 years working in Finance as a Registered Client Service Associate.  After I obtained my series 7, 66, 6, 63 and Life & Health licenses I began to master the art of servicing High Net Worth clients.  To give you some context the advisors I've worked for had assets under management of about $200,000,000.00. </p>
            
        <p>So why the change? I have learned all I can in my previous role and decided to further my skill set. What better way to learn and grow than to jump into a whole new arena? </p>
            
        <p>In 2019 I become a certified RYT 200 (Registered Yoga Teacher). I hope to take what I have learned on the mat and find new and interesting ways to incorporate it with my new career path.</p>
            
        <p>"Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.‚Äù -Rumi</p>
