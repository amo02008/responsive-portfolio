# responsive-portfolio
hmwrk 2 -using bootstrap
In the creation of this site I used the Navbar code from Bootstrap.  This allowed for a more dynamice page.
I also incorported elements from bootstrap that allow the page to be responsive. This will help to ensure the visibility regardless of the device being used to view the page.
